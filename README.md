# Github Stalker
A quite simple application that allows you to automatically download updates to selected repositories.\
I started this project to learn C#, so I apologize for some not-ideal solutions in the code.

### Todo
- [X] Core functionality
- [X] Storing and loading configuration
- [ ] Settings, such as the save folder
- [ ] Tracking of stars, forks and commits to external repositories
- [ ] Seperation of the client (GUI) and the server

### Screenshots
